## Targeting Malaria

With more than 3.2 billion people at risk, 200 million cases per year, and more than 400,000 deaths per year, malaria is one of the few remaining pandemics in the world. The best available vaccine imparts less than 50% protection for only a few months. While this gives hope that a protective vaccine is possible, we have far to go to reduce the global impact of theÂ disease.

Research indicates that our (link: /science/tech/icmv text: ICMV platform) could be ideally suited to drive strong and durable antibody responses against malaria antigens. We will continue to advance our technology with the goal of ultimately eradicating this pervasive and destructive disease.
