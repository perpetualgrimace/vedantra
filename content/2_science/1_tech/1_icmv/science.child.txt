## ICMVs solve stability problems

Interbilayer-crosslinked multilamellar vesicles (ICMVs) represent a new approach to lipid nanoparticle carriers. Where previous generations of lipid particles rapidly degrade inside the body, ICMVs do not. By stabilizing the lipid shell with cross-linked adjacent phospholipid bilayers, ICMVs significantly improve particle stability in vivo, maintaining their integrity over weeks to months.

This resiliency improves the efficacy of vaccine formulations by delivering antigens and adjuvants together to the lymph nodes, giving APCs both the context (danger signal) and target (antigen specific structure) to drive adaptive immune responses. In our malaria and HPV programs, we have demonstrated enhanced B and T cell responses against multiple antigens in both prophylactic and therapeutic contexts. ICMVs are manufactured in an entirely aqueous, gentle, and scalable process that has been validated by an outside GMPÂ CMO.
