## Exacting altruists wanted

Vedantra is in the business of outwitting some of the most malicious ailments of our time. We create targeted therapies that teach the immune system to kill what's making people sick. It takes advanced technical proficiency, creativity, and adaptability.

So we are always looking for scientists and engineers who are passionate in their relentless pursuit of better solutions. We need people who move quickly and never cut corners. We need team players who bring their whole selves into their work, not just their hands or their minds. The people who do best here are those who are able to do serious work with a sense of humility and optimism.
