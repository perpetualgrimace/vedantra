Text:

Historically, the problem with immunotherapy has been the lack of an effective adaptive immune response. The challenge: how to generate a therapeutic response while limiting exposure to toxic adjuvants or constitutively activated T cells. Vedantra develops methods to precisely target the adaptive immune system, using its natural processes to expand immune cells that destroy infected or cancerous cells without harming normal tissues.

## Focusing interaction on the immune system

Born from the Irvine Lab at MIT, Vedantra’s platform technologies are able to deliver agents directly to the antigen-presenting cells of the lymph nodes. As demonstrated in (link: /papers/icmv_as_synthetic_vaccines text: Nature Materials), (link: /papers/generation_of_effector_memory text: Science Translational Medicine), and (link: /papers/lymph_node_targeting_in_vaccines text: Nature), getting the right molecules to the right place reduces adjuvant toxicity while enhancing immune responses against an array of antigens in both cancer and infectious disease.
