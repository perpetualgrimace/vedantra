# Hi

This is a personal copy of my work on the Vedantra website. It's here solely for the purpose of displaying it on jamesferrell.me.

This website was originally built by me using Kirby CMS version 2. I've since upgraded it to Kirby 3 and generated a static copy. Due to this, the admin panel, contact form, pagination, search, and other features may no longer work.

I've also added `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` so search engines shouldn't list it.
